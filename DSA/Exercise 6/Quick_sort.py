'''
This program performs Quick sort algorithm for a given list of elements

Quick sort is a recursive sorting algorithm that divides an array into two halves, sorts them independently, and then merges the sorted halves to obtain a fully sorted array. It repeatedly divides the array until individual elements are reached, and then merges them in a sorted manner. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

Time complexity = O(n log(n)) -- Best case and average case
                = O(nÂ²) -- Worst case

    This functions sorts a sequence using quicksort algorithm recursively.
